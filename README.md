# tableau-intro-with-trees
Intro workshop to Tableau Public for Chicago Data Viz Community. Let's look at Chicago's trees!

## What this workshop will cover
- Tableau products, what they're useful for and how they compare to other data viz / BI tools
- Prepping data for Tableau
- Constructing dashboards
- Filtering data
- Maps
- Tooltips

## Why trees?
My passion is studying how the built environment impacts human health. Trees, which are amazing in nature, are integrally tied to the built environment in urban areas and have major impacts on our health. Learn more:

## Tree data
I'm still trying to decide which data will be used in this workshop. A few options:

- Chicago Region Trees Initiative has their [Municipal Canopy Summary](http://chicagorti.org/CanopySummaries) which covers each municipality in the 7-county area, plus parts of Chicago. It includes estimates for percent of land covered by trees, broken down by general land uses, as well as estimates of plantable space.
- The USDA Forest Service has data on tree Censuses conducted within the [City of Chicago in 2007](https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/data/urban/state/city/?city=15) and the [7-county region in 2010](https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/data/urban/state/city/?city=26). These data sets contain count estimates by tree species, estimates of their estimates of their carbon impact, and economic value. There are also estimates of canopy cover to paracite susceptibility, by type of paracite and land use.
